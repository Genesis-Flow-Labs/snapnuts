## Vision

Educational short-form content teaching keyboard shortcuts and productivity tips. Platform-agnostic (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok). Faceless format - value-first, personality optional.

**The Hook:** "The number = the division" - shortcuts that teach themselves.

**Working Title Ideas:**
- "Shortcut Academy"
- "Keys to Speed"
- "Command Everything"
- (TBD)

## Team Structure (EOS Model)

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Visionary** | Shafen | Ideas, direction, content strategy, creative vision |
| **Integrator** | CJ | Execution, editing, posting, systems, accountability |

**Commitment Level:** Side project (not full-time)

## Parallel Content Lane

ChatGPT is coaching a separate content track:
- **Topic:** Digital Identity / iPhone ID / Trust Infrastructure
- **Positioning:** "Translator" between systems, regulation, and real people
- **Strategy:** 1-2 posts/week for 30 days, build signal

Both lanes prove the same superpower: simplifying complex systems.
